            <h2>Visitors' Experiences and Reviews</h2>
			<p>I visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, and it was one of my best experience. Arriving by ferry, I was struck by the sheer scale and grandeur of the statue, which seems even more impressive up close. The views from the pedestal offered a breathtaking panorama of New York Harbor and the city skyline. Standing at the base, I felt a deep connection to the historical significance of the monument and its representation of freedom.
