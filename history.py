            <h2>History of the Statue of Liberty</h2>
            <p>The Statue of Liberty was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. Given as a gift from France to the United States, it was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue represents liberty and democracy and has become a symbol of freedom worldwide. Its construction was a collaborative effort between France and the United States, reflecting the strong bond between the two nations.</p>
            <p>The statue was originally built in France, then disassembled and shipped to New York City in 1885. After reassembly on Liberty Island, it was officially unveiled by President Grover Cleveland. Over the years, it has undergone several renovations to maintain its grandeur and ensure its preservation for future generations. Today, it remains one of the most recognized landmarks in the world.</p>
